# Introduction
I would like to share my first mobile application using the Cordova/Phonegap Javascript Framework.

In continuation of what I have learned in the mobile application, I decided to develop an app that would be beneficial to my visually impaired sister. My sister and her husband who happened to be visually impaired too lives in a separate house. Most of the time, they required assistance from another person to read their bills, grocery receipts, and ID. In times that they cannot call someone to assist them, there is no way to read those documents. So, I decided to create an app that can take a picture of the document and convert the image to text. There is a speaker icon where the text will be converted to voice.

Here is the architectural design of the application.
